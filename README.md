# STM32F429-Gesture-Lock-NYU-RTES

A gesture-based authentication system developed for ECE-GY 6483: Real Time Embedded Systems at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. This project implements motion pattern recognition using the STM32F429I-DISC1's built-in I3G4250D gyroscope.

## Overview
This project, also known as "Embedded Sentry", creates a security system where specific motion patterns serve as authentication keys. It demonstrates real-time embedded systems principles using the STM32F429 Discovery board.
